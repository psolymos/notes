# Weekely todo list  for project management

I haven't found a better system than using a piece of paper.
This system comes from a book that I can't remember the title of
(once I run into it again, I will cite it properly I swear).

## Motivation

* Keeping track of tasks and deadlines.
* Accountability.
* Transparency.

## Organization

### Quarters

A sheet of paper (letter size used here) has 2 sides. 
This means one can start managing 4 broad categories.
2 from the top down, and 2 more from the bottom up.
For me these are:

1. ABMI (driven by workplanning)
2. BAM (driven by workplanning)
3. Collaborations (*ad hoc* stuff that one can call it professional development)
4. Consuilting (out-of-working-hours income generating side projects)

### Rows

There are 40 rows on both pages. Rows are for individual tasks.
The 5 robric in the left hand side are for daily toto lists.
The top of the paper gets the start date of the week for sorting.
The bottom of the sheet can be used for anything (it says tasks for the week).
I usually highlight important but not urgent tasks there as a reminder
(these usually take a long time to finish, but should proceed anyways).

### Columns

* *DUE DATE* column is self explanatory (usually Month DD format).
* *DONE* is for indicating completed, in-progress, retired tasks.
* *TASKS* column gets a description (e.g. *respond to email*,
  *circulate final version*, *send invoice to XYZ*).

## Sheet life cycle

1. Start a new sheet every Monday (or Friday if you are so pedantic)
2. Carry forward task from last week's sheet that hasn't been 
   completed (write 'X' in the *DONE* column on last week's sheet
   if the task has retired). Task from last week are marked with a `+`
   (not `-` as the new ones, see below).
3. Past weeks' sheets are archived and stapled together on a quarterly basis.
4. Scanning is optional.

## Task life cycle

1. New task is added as a new line, with a `-` sign beside it.
  * If the task is done, it gets a `checkmark` in the *DONE* column.
  * Task in progress is denoted  with a `O` in the *DONE* column and is
    checked once completed.
2. Old tasks (tasks from previous weeks) are marked with a `+` 
  in the *TASKS* column (left end of the cells).
3. Tasks on hold are marked with a `W` (wait) at the right side of the *TASKS*
  column. This implies dependency on someone else.
4. Retired (no longer needed) tasks are marked with an `X` in the *DONE* column
  and are not carried forward to the next week.
5. An optional `?` in the *DONE* column indicates that task is
  likely to be retired.

To avoid confusion between top-down and bottom-up tasks,
I use `-` and `+` in the top-down case, and `.` and `o` (dot and dot in circle)
for bottom-up tasks.
